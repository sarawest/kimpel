<h2>Ben Drew Kimpel</h2><img id="kimpel" src="benkimpel.jpg"> 

<p>Ben Drew Kimpel, a professor of English at the University of Arkansas (UA) in Fayetteville (Washington County) from 1952 to 1983, was a widely respected scholar and linguist. He wrote the definitive biography of eighteenth-century novelist Samuel Richardson with UA colleague Duncan Eaves; they also published numerous articles on Richardson and the works of twentieth-century poet Ezra Pound and edited a 1971 edition of Richardson’s novel Pamela.</p> 

<p>Ben Kimpel was born on November 5, 1915, in Fort Smith (Sebastian County). He was the only son of attorney Ben Drew Kimpel Sr. and Gladys Kimpel.</p>

<p>Kimpel attended the public schools (with a private tutor in French) and graduated from Fort Smith High School at age fourteen. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire for two years before enrolling at Harvard in 1931. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in English in 1936. To satisfy his mother, he attended Harvard Law School for one semester but then transferred to the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, where he received his MA in English in 1939.</p>

<p>Visiting his mother in Fort Smith, he passed through Fayetteville to visit friends. They convinced him to join the UA English department faculty, where he remained for more than thirty years. He taught a wide variety of courses, from Anglo-Saxon and Beowulf to contemporary novel. He told his teaching assistants that a lecturer's knowledge of the course material should be like an iceberg, with only one-eighth showing above the surface, and also insisted there was no excuse for not correcting and returning every exam and paper by the next class period.</p>

<p>For three semesters, he co-taught a course in twentieth-century thought with Dr. Lothar Schafer of the chemistry department, treating parallel developments in modern science and literature. In 1961, he was the first recipient of UA’s Alumni Association Faculty Distinguished Achievement Award.</p>

<p>Kimpel died on April 21, 1983, at his home in Fayetteville. He was sitting in his favorite armchair, preparing for his usual evening conference with Eaves, a volume of Pound's Cantos in his lap, a Chinese dictionary on the table beside him, and an unlit cigarette and a pack of matches in his hand. He is buried in Fort Smith. The UA Communications Building was renamed Kimpel Hall in his honor.</p>
